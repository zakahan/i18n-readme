# i18n-readme
A command-line tool to automatically generate multilingual README files using AI translation.

[English](README.md) | [中文](README_zh.md) | [日本語](README_ja.md) | [한국어](README_ko.md)

## Installation
```bash
# Install with uv (recommended)
uv add --dev git+https://github.com/zakahan/i18n-readme.git

# Or with pip
pip install git+https://github.com/zakahan/i18n-readme.git
```

## Usage
```bash
cd /your/project/path  # The project must have a README.md file
i18n-readme run \
  --base_lang en \  # just to exclude the original README.md language type
  --api_key your_api_key \
  --api_model_name doubao-seed-1-6-250615 \
  --api_base_url https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3 \
  --lang_list zh,ja,ko
```

## Parameter Description
- `--base_path`: Path to the base README file (default: `README.md`)
- `--base_lang`: Base language of the original README (default: `en`, supports: zh, en, ja, ko, fr, de, es, ru, ar, pt, it, hi, bn, pa, jv, id, ms)
- `--api_key`: API key for translation service (reads from `API_KEY` environment variable if not provided)
- `--api_model_name`: Name of the AI model to use (required, reads from `API_MODEL_NAME` environment variable if not provided)
- `--api_base_url`: Base URL for the API (reads from `API_BASE_URL` environment variable if not provided)
- `--lang_list`: Comma-separated list of target languages (default: `zh,en,ja,ko`)

## Supported Languages
This tool currently supports translation into the following languages: 
(In fact, it depends on what languages your model supports. Therefore, the language capabilities are fully dependent on the model capabilities. If you think there is a problem with the translation, please don't blame me, orz)
- Chinese (zh)
- English (en)
- Japanese (ja)
- Korean (ko)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Spanish (es)
- Russian (ru)
- Arabic (ar)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Italian (it)
- Hindi (hi)
- Bengali (bn)
- Punjabi (pa)
- Javanese (jv)
- Indonesian (id)
- Malay (ms)

## Output
Translated files will be generated in the current directory with the format: `README_{lang}.md`
Example: `README_zh.md`, `README_ja.md`

## Environment Variables
You can configure API credentials using environment variables instead of command-line arguments:
```bash
# Set API key
export API_KEY=your_api_key

# Set model name
export API_MODEL_NAME=doubao-seed-1-6-250615

# Set API base URL (optional)
export API_BASE_URL=https://ark.cn-beijing.volces.com/api/v3
```

### Instructions
The current model call is based on litellm and the OpenAI API mode, so the OpenAI format is used by default for the call.

## What's Next
- Support for `diff` and `overwrite` modes
- Batch processing of multiple documentation files
- Custom translation prompts
- Translation quality improvements

## By the way

Just as you guessed, these READMEs were of course generated by this project. 
(So please don't blame me for any language translation errors. `It's not me, it's the weapons`)
